Hello everyone. My name is Keivan Mirzaei and I am a math student. This is a personal website with the intention of promoting and introducing math problems to a wide range of students and math enthusiasts. It is a fun activity of mine as I usually spend my free hours on thinking to math problems.


As a warm-up you can show that if the points of the plane are each colored <b style="color:red;">red</b> or <b style="color:green;">green</b>, then one of these colors contains pairs of points at every mutual distance.
